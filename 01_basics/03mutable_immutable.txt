Mutable and Immutable in Python

Mutable ==> changeable
Immutable ==> Unchangeable

data types are objects

Strings are Immutable
    >>> username = "Binayak"
    >>> username
    'Binayak'

    >>> username = "chai"
    >>> username
    'chai'
    
    But here the username string is changed

>>> x = 10
>>> z = x
>>> x
10
>>> z
10
>>> x = 15
>>> z
10
>>> x
15
>>>

    In above scenario, 10 reference is x , and z is also refering to 10, 
    when x = 15 , so the previous referenceof x changes to 15
    but we have not changed the z reference it is always refering to 10 directly
    not the x



        -- Python Internal Working --
            most of the things in python are made as object

            Memory reference has object
            for example ,
                username = "binayak"

                the string binayak becomes a objects its reference value never changes so it is called immutable\

                Now, username = "Kunwor"

                now the username reference to kunwor String
                    and the automatic garbage collector removes the reference to "binayaK'

            So , the real meaning is the memory reference can't be change


    But, MUTABLE DATA TYPES reference can be changed directly in the memory
    these are not constant or variables
