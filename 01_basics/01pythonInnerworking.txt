PY source code --- > Byte Code --- > Python VM(Virtual Machine)

VM fetches the Bytecode and runs the programm
Most of the time the ByteCode is hidden, times like importing .py modules the bytecode is generated as folder __pycache__

Step 1.) Compile to ByteCode
            low level & Platform Independent (ByteCode)

    -.pyc -->  this is compiled python (frozen Binaries)

    (__pycache__)
        system folder for compiled codes and maintains the version too
        used for internal working by python

    hello_world.cpython-312.pyc
    as our source code changes a diff algo( difference tracking algorithm is used )
    compare the changes of the previous and current Source Code

    .cpython == standard python (312) is the version

    works only for imported files
    not for top level files

Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

-->Code to loop to iterate byte code
-->Runt time Engine
-->Also Known as Python Interpreter

Byte Code is not machine code

-->Python Specific Interpretation
-->cpython(Standard Implementation), jython, Ironpython, Stackless, PyPy
